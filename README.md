# CS6340 Project 2: Predict Real Estate Sale Prices

Repository for my notebooks and data for the second project in CS6340.

## Running locally

I use Visual Studio Code with the Python and Jupyter plugins for my local development. It takes care of starting a local Jupyter server and has many keyboard shortcuts for running notebooks. Once you have those installed, open VS Code at the root of your clone of this repo, create and activate a `virtualenv`, and `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, just pop open a notebook and start running some cells, making sure to point the IPython kernel at the `python` executable in your `virtualenv` (this _should_ only need to be done the first time you run a cell).
